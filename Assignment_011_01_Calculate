# Problem : If you had deposited a coin on the cryptocurrency exchange that brought 7% fixed profit daily for a week, how much would your $ 1000 reach at the end of the 7th day?

present_value = 1000

fixed_profit = 0.07

days= 7

future_value= present_value*((1+fixed_profit)**days) 

print (future_value)
